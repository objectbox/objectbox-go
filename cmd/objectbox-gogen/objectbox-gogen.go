/*
Generates objectbox related code for ObjectBox entities (Go structs)

It can be used by adding `//go:generate go run github.com/objectbox/objectbox-go/cmd/objectbox-gogen` comment inside a .go file
containing the struct that you want to persist and executing `go generate` in the module

Alternatively, you can run the command manually:

	objectbox-gogen [flags] {source-file}
		to generate the binding code

or

	objectbox-gogen clean {path}
		to remove the generated files instead of creating them - this removes *.obx.go and objectbox-model.go but keeps objectbox-model.json

path:
  - a source file path or a valid path pattern as accepted by the go tool (e.g. ./...)
  - if not given, the generator expects GOFILE environment variable to be set

Available flags:

	-byValue
	  	getters should return a struct value (a copy) instead of a struct pointer
	-help
	  	print this help
	-out string
	  	output path for generated source files
	-persist string
	  	path to the model information persistence file (JSON)
	-version
	  	print the generator version info

To learn more about different configuration and annotations for entities, see docs at https://golang.objectbox.io/
